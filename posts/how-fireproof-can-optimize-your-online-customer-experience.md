In today’s rapidly evolving digital world, a company’s online presence is crucial. Customers visit your offices rarely or never, but they visit your website constantly. Businesses must embrace tools that provide top-tier customer experiences, while managing costs & mitigating risk. [Fireproof](https://use-fireproof.com/), a real-time database designed for web applications, enables these use cases by shifting key data workloads to the user application instance. Let’s explore some examples in detail.

First is risk management. For businesses, the real-time analysis of threats and anomalies has become a necessity. Many threats begin at an “endpoint,” which is cybersecurity jargon for a user’s computer or other device outside the core network (printers, networking equipment etc). As the most commonly used type of application software in the world, web browsers demand special attention. Fireproof can be utilized to store and manage signatures and threat profiles within each user instance of your web application. Threat detections can be reported back to your existing security infrastructure, whether you’re using [SIEM, EDR, XDR](https://logrhythm.com/blog/a-guide-to-edr-ndr-xdr-and-siem/), [UEBA, SOAR](https://thisvsthat.io/soar-vs-ueba) or some combination. The benefits are immense — by detecting a threat while it’s still at the endpoint, before it can propagate, you have the chance to eliminate it before any damage is done. This is especially true in any environment that operates critical systems, such as healthcare or finance.

Next is customer service automation. By leveraging Fireproof, businesses can implement sophisticated AI chatbots running locally in the user’s application instance, delivering a fluid, low-latency user experience. Research by Google and others shows that people will keep coming back for responsive user interfaces, and [increasingly avoid](https://research.google/blog/speed-matters/) slow ones. Fireproof can also keep a local history of all interactions, send them to the backend periodically for aggregation and further analysis, or delete them to stay in compliance with local privacy laws and regulations.

Third is personalized customer experience. In retail and e-commerce, personalized interactions are directly linked to customer retention and repeat sales. Fireproof supports businesses in analyzing customer behavior in real time, without numerous costly round trips to the backend. This enables tailored recommendations and services in a cost effective manner, which in turn provides a high level of personalization. Customers feel valued and understood, fostering loyalty and increasing engagement.

The final example is perhaps the most important: optimizing for cost & performance. Many web & SaaS applications that are more than a few years old were built based on unsustainable assumptions. If your application’s current operational model is underwater or not performing to expectations, Fireproof can help. Much of what was traditionally handled via excessive communication with overbuilt backend infrastructure can be shifted up front, greatly reducing operational costs while increasing simplicity, reliability, and responsiveness.
