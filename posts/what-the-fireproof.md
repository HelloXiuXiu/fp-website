Database complexity is a big problem in the app development world, and getting bigger as apps get easier and faster to write. Learn how Fireproof is solving this problem, and why the opportunity matters.

### Problem

When building new apps or features, developers are accustomed to heavy context switches when configuring databases, taking them away from the valuable action in the app codebase and into administration, provisioning, defining, and connecting databases. Even in the best-case scenario, database management can easily amount to half the time (and frustration) of getting to an app’s first “hello world.”

In the AI era, as app development becomes increasingly rapid and streamlined, traditional database models are falling short. Configuration and setup are becoming major bottlenecks, and administrative and management demands grow proportionally. Traditional databases were built for a world that viewed applications as specialized, unique projects that require significant resources to maintain and modify. This is no longer a viable approach in this era of fast-paced application development. 

A high threshold to start new projects holds back innovation. The complexity and cost of database management, both upfront and ongoing, can make it hard to justify the long-term benefits of new development, so the downside of traditional databases can be measured in terms of features and apps not written, and concepts not explored.

### Introducing Fireproof

Fireproof's unique architecture not only makes the development process more efficient but also provides flexibility in handling scale. Developers can choose between browser-first with peer-to-peer sync (free), a user-paid cloud model (crowdfunding, micropayments), or traditional app-paid cloud (developer pays). This approach makes economic bottlenecks a thing of the past, empowering developers with more choice and control. Open source communities can manage anything except for a bank account, and opening the market to these users will also make Fireproof easy to adopt by commercial developers.

Fireproof takes data integrity lessons from the crypto community instead of and uses them to make the database experience flexible, faster, cheaper, and more trustworthy. Designed so you can develop apps first and connect them to the cloud when you are ready, you can get a Fireproof app ready to demo in the time it would take to provision your API key with another database. Stay ahead of the curve with Passkey integration, or use your existing auth -– end-to-end encryption means Fireproof can run in any cloud. Embodying a mantra of “build, connect, scale,” Fireproof introduces the notion of cryptographically-verified data anywhere to real-time embedded application databases.

As a business, Fireproof expects better margins than commodity cloud infrastructure vendors, because our database is designed to be embedded in mission-critical applications like custom ERP tools, Salesforce add-ons, LLM prompt-based experiences, social media, e-commerce, metaverse, and anywhere else that depends on data integrity and fast-paced innovation. This leads to deep customer relationships (the lifeblood of any successful database company) and value-added offerings like installation certification and support. In the long term, we hope to be a financial bridge between our enterprise customers and the distributed service providers we utilize, offering the opportunity to expand our platform over time.

### Take action

Today, Fireproof is ready for developers to use in low-risk deployments like shopping carts, personal LLM apps, and peer-to-peer gaming. You can install our React hooks with `npm install use-fireproof` or use the core database in any JavaScript app. Fireproof’s cloud storage, shipping soon, will enable big data and multi-user apps. We are currently seeking funding as well as hiring engineers and evangelists and growing our open-source community.
