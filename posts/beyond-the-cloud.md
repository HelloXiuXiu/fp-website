Fireproof has its roots in the [cloudless movement I identified in my 2023 O'Reilly Radar article](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/the-paradigm-shift-to-cloudless-computing/). Fireproof's data anywhere promise, as reflected in our PartyKit, Netlify, AWS, and IPFS connectors is aligned with the cloudless vision. Fireproof Cloud leverages the data integrity guarantees of cloudless to offer unparalleled ease of use and flexibility.

Fireproof Cloud will offer one-click onboarding to live data, an experience hard to match without Fireproof's Merkle integrity. This will make Fireproof the easiest way to get started with a database, and the most powerful way to extend legacy apps and write backend-independent components. The Cloud dashboard makes Fireproof tangible, easy-to-use, and provides a foundation for future features.

Fireproof Cloud will have advanced querying: 

- CSV import/export and REST queries support data science notebooks. 
- Full-text and vector indexes simplify in-browser retrieval augmented generation by shifting index generation to the cloud. 
- Global indexes enable querying across all databases, facilitating complex operations like reporting across multiple retail locations or analyzing app installations on a macro scale. 

Look at Firebase, Supabase, and AWS Amplify to imagine how this product line matures, with features to support the full needs of an integrated application.

Over time, we'll optimize for less-expert adjacent customers, aligning with our shadow IT goals and platform trends. If your enterprise is using Fireproof for some back office thing, and you find that you can run reports via the Fireproof dashboard... that is the kind of stickiness we strive to achieve, for a more general audience as we grow. The industry is poised for a revolution as previously expensive to modify apps become routine to automate. Fireproof means developers don't have to worry about the backend to write interactive, collaborative apps with the data integrity AI copilots demand.

Fireproof Cloud can optimize the experience for developers of all skill levels while providing services to apps of any scale, without compromising our cloudless principles. Cloudless means services can collaborate to provide different layers of the stack, so Fireproof can offer our advanced enterprise features to users, regardless of whether they host with Fireproof Cloud, another provider, or on-premises. Even cloudless apps can benefit from always online endpoints, and Fireproof Cloud provides that option.
